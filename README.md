## This is the exact and same Slowloris as the official one but with the option to use IPV6.

# ðŸš¨ THE IPV6 FEATURE CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK

- YOU CAN STILL USE IT BUT JUST NOT THE "--ipv6" FEATURE

# To use the IPV6 option:
1. Add "--ipv6" while using it.
2. Ex. "python3 slowloris.py --ipv6 (ipv6 goes here)"
